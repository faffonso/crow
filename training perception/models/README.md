# IC_NN_LIDAR: Models

> This package contains the models generated by the neural network. The models are stored in the following format: "model_{runid}" where N is the number of the model.

## Model Description

For further information about the models, please check the `src/main.py` file. In this code you will see the generation of the model after the training. With that, it is worth noticing that the `runid` variable is compose of `datetime.now().strftime("%d-%m-%Y_%H-%M-%S")`. This means that the model is stored with the date and time of the training.

### Deprecated Models

Some old models are stored in the `deprecated` folder. These models are not used anymore and are stored for historical purposes. This old models were generated during the training/test phase and are all low performing models.
